    "Min-Max scaling is a normalization technique used in data preprocessing to rescale the features of a dataset to a fixed range. The range is usually [0, 1], but it can be any desired range. The formula for Min-Max scaling is:\n",
    "\n",
    "X_new = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min)\n",
    "\n",
    "where X is a feature, X_min is the minimum value of the feature, X_max is the maximum value of the feature, and X_new is the rescaled value of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Min-Max scaling is useful when the values of the features in the dataset have different scales or units of measurement, wQ2ch can cause problems for some machine learning algorithms. By rescaling the features to a fixed range, the differences in the scale and units of measurement are removed, and the algorithm can better interpret the importance of each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the minimum and maximum values of the square footage feature are 500 and 5000, respectively, and the minimum and maximum values of the number of bedrooms feature are 1 and 6, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we apply the formula for Min-Max scaling to each value in each feature to rescale the features to a fixed range. For example, the rescaled value of a house with 2500 square footage would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "(2500 - 500) / (5000 - 500) = 0.4167\n",
    "\n",
    "And the rescaled value of a house with 3 bedrooms would be:\n",

    "The Unit Vector technique, also known as the normalization method, is a feature scaling technique used in data preprocessing. It scales the values in the feature vector to have unit norm, which means that the length of the vector is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Min-Max scaling, which scales the values in a fixed range (usually [0, 1]), the Unit Vector technique preserves the direction of the original data while ensuring that each feature has equal importance in the model.\n",

    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used for dimensionality reduction, which is a process of reducing the number of features in a dataset by selecting a smaller subset of relevant features that still retains most of the information. PCA is used to identify patterns in data and to find the underlying structure of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA works by finding the principal components of the data, which are new variables that are linear combinations of the original features. The first principal component has the largest possible variance, and each subsequent component has the highest possible variance subject to being orthogonal to the previous components.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA can be applied to any dataset, but is particularly useful for datasets with a large number of features, where it is difficult to visualize the data or to identify patterns. It can also be used to reduce the computational cost of other machine learning algorithms, by reducing the number of features that need to be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how PCA can be used in dimensionality reduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset with 5 features (columns) and 1000 samples (rows). We want to reduce the number of features to 3 while retaining as much information as possible. We can use PCA to achieve this by following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardize the data: We need to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This is done to ensure that each feature has the same scale and is equally important in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the covariance matrix: The covariance matrix shows how the features are related to each other. It is a measure of how much the features vary together. We can calculate the covariance matrix by taking the dot product of the standardized data with its transpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors: The eigenvectors represent the principal components of the data, and the eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each principal component. We can calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the top k eigenvectors: We can select the top k eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues, where k is the number of principal components we want to retain.\n",

    "Extraction? Provide an example to illustrate this concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA (Principal Component Analysis) can be used for feature extraction, which is a process of transforming raw input features into a smaller set of meaningful features. Feature extraction can help reduce the computational burden of machine learning algorithms and improve their performance by removing redundant and irrelevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA works by finding a new set of features that are linear combinations of the original features. These new features, called principal components, are selected in such a way that they capture the maximum amount of variation in the data. The first principal component captures the most variation, followed by the second, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use PCA for feature extraction, we can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardize the data: It is important to standardize the data before applying PCA to ensure that all features are on the same scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the covariance matrix: The covariance matrix represents the relationships between pairs of features. We can compute the covariance matrix using the standardized data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix: The eigenvectors represent the directions in which the data varies the most, and the eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the top k eigenvectors: We can select the top k eigenvectors that explain the most variance in the data. These eigenvectors become the new set of features.\n",

    "Suppose we have a dataset with 5 features: age, income, education level, work experience, and gender. We want to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by extracting the most important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply PCA to this dataset by following the steps outlined above. Let's say we want to select the top 2 eigenvectors, which capture the most variation in the data. After computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, we find that the first two eigenvectors have eigenvalues of 3.5 and 1.8, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can select the first two eigenvectors as our new set of features and transform the data using these eigenvectors. The first eigenvector might represent a combination of age, income, and work experience, while the second eigenvector might represent a combination of education level and gender.\n",

    "In the case of predicting stock prices, PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by selecting the most important features that explain the majority of the variance in the data. For example, the financial data of a company can be reduced to a few key features that are most predictive of stock price movements, such as revenue, earnings, and debt. Market trends can also be reduced to a few key features, such as interest rates and GDP growth, that are most predictive of stock price movements.
